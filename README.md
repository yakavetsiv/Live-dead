# Live-dead
Image processing script for calculation of cell viability of 3D spheroids in microfluidic arrays. 

# Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Image pre-processing
The best performance is assumed for the images of single quadruplet device. For calculation of cell viability two channels (0:live and 1:dead) are required.

# Running the script
```
python live-dead.py
```
Estimation of the absolute cell viability values for single time point:
1.	Analysis of images
2.	Browse - Select the folder with the file
3.	Select the image
4.	Load image
5.	Grid
